## Developing a Research Topic


### What is a research topic?

"A [research] topic is an approach to a subject, one that asks a question whose answer solves a problem that your readers care about." (Booth et al., 2014)


### What is a _good_ research topic?

Is the topic of interest to you?

Does the topic fit the parameters laid out by the instructor?

Are there sufficient resources available on the topic?

Is the topic narrow enough to be addressed in a research paper?

Islamic thought in the modern world

Narrow topic: The effect of the popular uprisings in Egypt during the 2010s on Islamic political philosophy

Representations of queerness in the media

Narrow topic: The conflict between _machismo_ and queer identity in recent Latin American film


### A scaffold for research topics

#### Name your topic

I am researching...

**I am researching** the conflict between _machismo_ and queer identity in recent Latin American film

#### Add an indirect question

...because I want to find out who/what/where/when/wether/why/how...

**because I want to find out how** how these films portray masculinity

#### Answer the _so what?_

...in order to help my reader understand...

**in order to help my reader understand** how the media plays a role in the construction of gender norms.

#### Putting it all together

I am researching the conflict between _machismo_ and queer identity in recent Latin American films
because I want to find out how these films portray masculinity
in order to help my reader understand how the media plays a role in the construction of gender norms.


### Workshop: Choosing a research topic

1. Write down a series of interests you have in the context of this course (don't worry about being too specific yet).

2. From this list of interests, pick a topic that interests you the most.

3. Narrow your topic by getting more specific. 
    * narrow by time period
    * narrow by location
    * narrow by academic discipline

4. Ask a specific question of your topic.
    * What is the history of...?
    * How do we classify X?
    * How does X compare to Y?
    * Why does X happen?
    * What affect does X have on Y?

5. Articulate the significance of your topic.

6. Create a scaffold for your research topic:
<br>
"I am researching...
<br>
because I want to find out...
<br>
in order to help my reader understand...


### Moving forward:

Begin collecting research materials by using key words from your topic as search terms in JumboSearch and other library databases.
